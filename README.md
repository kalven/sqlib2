# sqlib2

sqlib2 is a thin C++ wrapper for the SQLite database library.

## Compatibility

sqlib2 requires:

* A somewhat recent version of SQLite 3 (tested with 3.6.16).
* A not too shabby version of Boost (tested with 1.40).
* A C++ compiler with reasonable C++0x support, variadic templates in particular (tested with GCC 4.4.1).

## Usage

See tests/basic_test.cpp for now.
